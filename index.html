            8/21-24/23 - Week 1 <br> This week we talked about saftey requirments for OSHA and did a project<br>
            of getting a marble the logest distance that we could under certian requrments. Our stratagy<br> 
            was to line people up in a line and have them trade off the pipes to pass the marble along. <br> 
            It worked well even though it took a while to get the hang of. We also started learning about<br> 
            makeing our website.

            8/28-8/31 - Week 2 <br> This week we took the quiz on the enginering proccess and saftey. We also started to <br>
            design a complicated way to get a baseball to pop a ballon. We started using tinkercad this week and I made a <br>
            cat bed with a cat in it. I find tinkercad really hard to control even though I understand the theory of how to <br>
             use it. I am better at using tinkercad then I was the first time and will keep improving. <br>

            9/5-9/7 - Week 3 <br> This week we finished our tinkercad for the ruth goldberg design. Today we started on creating the machine <br>
            and so far it is going well. My team had a rough start with who our group was being unclear but it is now finaled out with me and Bug <br>
            in a group with just each other now. I forsee that there will be complications with what we are making in the future but for now every <br>
            is going well. We have gotten some of the base pieces cut out so far and have started working on the pulley sytem which will take a while.

            9/11-9/14 - Week 4 <br> This week we finished working on our Rube Goldberg machines and tested them. The bigist change that we made was <br>
            that we removed the car from existence. We also added a lot more supports and the ballon ended up being atached to the outside of the <br>
            structure rather than inside it. Because of this the needle position was also changed from the top of the lever to the bottom. While <br>
            testing we did have to do a few runs and adjust a few things, such as further sucuring the needle, for it to work. Overall the project <br>
            went really well and I am very happy with the way the design turned out. The main thing that I would change would be that the final slope <br>
            was steeper but it did work as is so I'm still happy with it.

           9/18-9/21 - Week 5 <br> This week we did two challange projects. The first was to make a flotation device with one piece of paper, sissorcs <br>
           and tape in twentey minutes. The goal was for your device to float for five minutes with the heaviest whieght. I made a boat thing with paper <br>
           extending from sides and I won the challange with the weight being 136. The other project was to draw a desgien for an E and then following <br>
           the instructions of someone eles's E cut it out. I don't know how I did on that one yet because we have not gotten our grades for it back yet. <br>
           I had a lot of fun with both challenges and look forward to more in the future.

           9/25-9/28 - Week 6 <br> This week we did a lab where we disected a computer. We got to look through all of the parts and then we put it back to <br>
           together. Me and Bug ended up takeing appart the hard drive and the CD player as well because we where curious. We finished the main part <br>
           quickly but taking the additional two pices apart add quite a bit of time on. The hard drive had a very shiny interior and was super fagile so <br>
           we where not allowed to poke around the inside of it much but we got to poke around a bit in the CD player. Me and Bug are planing to find some <br>
           older electronics so that we can take those apart in the future.

          10/2-10/5 - Week 7 <br> This week we did a challange where we made a cardboard prothstetic hand that picked up an empty water bottle. I worked on this <br>
          challange with Bug and we manged to make it work pretty quickly without looking at a design online first. After we got it to work we looked at online <br>
          designs in order to improve it. Our design was based around trying to mimic the human hand with how tendons work. The bigest problem we encountered <br>
          was not having enough grip so we fixed this by wraping rubberbands around the finger tips of the hand. I don't think that I really leared anything new <br>
          this week, because I have had and intrest in bioengineering in the past, but I had a lot of fun reviwing it and working on the hand project.
