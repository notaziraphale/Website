            8/21-24/23 - Week 1 <br> This week we talked about saftey requirments for OSHA and did a project<br>
            of getting a marble the logest distance that we could under certian requrments. Our 
            stratagy<br> was to line people up in a line and have them trade off the pipes to pass the marble along. 
            It worked well even though it took a while to get the hang of. We also started learning about<br> makeing
