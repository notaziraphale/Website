            8/21-24/23 - Week 1 <br> This week we talked about saftey requirments for OSHA and did a project<br>
            of getting a marble the logest distance that we could under certian requrments. Our stratagy<br> 
            was to line people up in a line and have them trade off the pipes to pass the marble along. <br> 
            It worked well even though it took a while to get the hang of. We also started learning about<br> 
            makeing our website.

            8/28-8/31 - Week 2 <br> This week we took the quiz on the enginering proccess and saftey. We also started to <br>
            design a complicated way to get a baseball to pop a ballon. We started using tinkercad this week and I made a <br>
            cat bed with a cat in it. I find tinkercad really hard to control even though I understand the theory of how to <br>
             use it. I am better at using tinkercad then I was the first time and will keep improving. <br>

            9/5-9/7 - Week 3 <br> This week we finished our tinkercad for the ruth goldberg design. Today we started on creating the machine <br>
            and so far it is going well. My team had a rough start with who our group was being unclear but it is now finaled out with me and Bug <br>
            in a group with just each other now. I forsee that there will be complications with what we are making in the future but for now every <br>
            is going well. We have gotten some of the base pieces cut out so far and have started working on the pulley sytem which will take a while.

            9/11-9/14 - Week 4 <br> This week we finished working on our Rube Goldberg machines and tested them. The bigist change that we made was <br>
            that we removed the car from existence. We also added a lot more supports and the ballon ended up being atached to the outside of the <br>
            structure rather than inside it. Because of this the needle position was also changed from the top of the lever to the bottom. While <br>
            testing we did have to do a few runs and adjust a few things, such as further sucuring the needle, for it to work. Overall the project <br>
            went really well and I am very happy with the way the design turned out. The main thing that I would change would be that the final slope <br>
            was steeper but it did work as is so I'm still happy with it.

           9/18-9/21 - Week 5 <br> This week we did two challange projects. The first was to make a flotation device with one piece of paper, sissorcs <br>
           and tape in twentey minutes. The goal was for your device to float for five minutes with the heaviest whieght. I made a boat thing with paper <br>
           extending from sides and I won the challange with the weight being 136. The other project was to draw a desgien for an E and then following <br>
           the instructions of someone eles's E cut it out. I don't know how I did on that one yet because we have not gotten our grades for it back yet. <br>
           I had a lot of fun with both challenges and look forward to more in the future.

           9/25-9/28 - Week 6 <br> This week we did a lab where we disected a computer. We got to look through all of the parts and then we put it back to <br>
           together. Me and Bug ended up takeing appart the hard drive and the CD player as well because we where curious. We finished the main part <br>
           quickly but taking the additional two pices apart add quite a bit of time on. The hard drive had a very shiny interior and was super fagile so <br>
           we where not allowed to poke around the inside of it much but we got to poke around a bit in the CD player. Me and Bug are planing to find some <br>
           older electronics so that we can take those apart in the future.

          10/2-10/5 - Week 7 <br> This week we did a challange where we made a cardboard prothstetic hand that picked up an empty water bottle. I worked on this <br>
          challange with Bug and we manged to make it work pretty quickly without looking at a design online first. After we got it to work we looked at online <br>
          designs in order to improve it. Our design was based around trying to mimic the human hand with how tendons work. The bigest problem we encountered <br>
          was not having enough grip so we fixed this by wraping rubberbands around the finger tips of the hand. I don't think that I really leared anything new <br>
          this week, because I have had and intrest in bioengineering in the past, but I had a lot of fun reviwing it and working on the hand project.

          10/9-10/12 - Week 8 <br> This week we started learning about aerospace engineering. We started a new project for areospace engineering that is launching <br>
          a 2 liter soda bottle as far as we can. We have had to go into pairs where we are not working with someone that we know or have worked with in the past. <br>
          Today we started to desiging the bottle on tinkercad and I am not sure how much I did the asignment correctly. Our teacher said to make a rocket or <br>
          airplane and I leaned more twoards an airplane design which may not have been the wisest move. I choose to do more of an airplane design becuase the challange <br>
          is to have it go the farthest is distance not the highest up and airplanes are designed after birds with the goal to travel far rather then high. To be specific <br>
          I based my design off of a wandering albatross which can fly without flaping thier wings fo hours at a time. Of course this has far more to do with how they <br>
          use dynamic soaring while in flight, which I would not be able to replacate in this challange, but their wing shape and body proportaions do still play a <br>
          big part in how they are able to fly for so long at such high speeds. Another part of how they fly for so long is that the birds lock their joints as by <br>
          doing that they save a lot of energy. A fun fact about wandering albatross is that they have one of the longest wingspans of all flying birds, able to <br>
          get up to a wingspan of just under 12ft.

         10/23-10/27 Week 9 <br> This week we cleaned water using filters. Me and Bug worked on the project together and the order of materials we chose was cotton <br>
         balls at the bottom, then the sand, the pebbles, and finally the rocks. Because we where not allowed more materials but our fillter was to dirty to do anything <br>
         after only 2 run throughs we decided to clean the fillter. We did this by running clean water though the filter until the water ran clear and then we ran the <br>
         dirty water through the filter again. We repeated this prosses until the water that was orgiganlly dirty ran clear. We got our water the clearest out of <br>
         everyone and I do not think there is a way that we could have made it clearer with the time and materials that we had. I am very happy with our results and <br>
         had a lot of fun with this project.
