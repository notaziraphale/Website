            8/21-24/23 - Week 1 <br> This week we talked about saftey requirments for OSHA and did a project<br>
            of getting a marble the logest distance that we could under certian requrments. Our 
            stratagy<br> was to line people up in a line and have them trade off the pipes to pass the marble along. 
            It worked well even though it took a while to get the hang of. We also started learning about<br> makeing
            our website.

            8/28-8/31 - Week 2 <br> This week we took the quiz on the enginering proccess and saftey. We also started to 
            design a complicated way to get a baseball to pop a ballon. We started using tinkercad this week and I made a 
            cat bed with a cat in it. I find tinkercad really hard to control even though I understand the theory of how to 
             use it. I am better at using tinkercad then I was the first time and will keep improving.

            9/5-9/7 - Week 3 <br> This week we finished our tinkercad for the ruth goldberg design. Today we started on creating the machine <br>
            and so far it is going well. My team had a rough start with who our group was being unclear but it is now finaled out with me and Bug <br>
            in a group with just each other now. I forsee that there will be complications with what we are making in the future but for now every <br>
            is going well. We have gotten some of the base pieces cut out so far and have started working on the pulley sytem which will take a while.
