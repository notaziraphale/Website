            8/21-24/23 - Week 1 <br> This week we talked about saftey requirments for OSHA and did a project<br>
            of getting a marble the logest distance that we could under certian requrments. Our stratagy<br> 
            was to line people up in a line and have them trade off the pipes to pass the marble along. <br> 
            It worked well even though it took a while to get the hang of. We also started learning about<br> 
            makeing our website.

            8/28-8/31 - Week 2 <br> This week we took the quiz on the enginering proccess and saftey. We also started to <br>
            design a complicated way to get a baseball to pop a ballon. We started using tinkercad this week and I made a <br>
            cat bed with a cat in it. I find tinkercad really hard to control even though I understand the theory of how to <br>
             use it. I am better at using tinkercad then I was the first time and will keep improving. <br>

            9/5-9/7 - Week 3 <br> This week we finished our tinkercad for the ruth goldberg design. Today we started on creating the machine <br>
            and so far it is going well. My team had a rough start with who our group was being unclear but it is now finaled out with me and Bug <br>
            in a group with just each other now. I forsee that there will be complications with what we are making in the future but for now every <br>
            is going well. We have gotten some of the base pieces cut out so far and have started working on the pulley sytem which will take a while.

            9/11-9/14 - Week 4 <br> This week we finished working on our Rube Goldberg machines and tested them. The bigist change that we made was <br>
            that we removed the car from existence. We also added a lot more supports and the ballon ended up being atached to the outside of the <br>
            structure rather than inside it. Because of this the needle position was also changed from the top of the lever to the bottom. While <br>
            testing we did have to do a few runs and adjust a few things, such as further sucuring the needle, for it to work. Overall the project <br>
            went really well and I am very happy with the way the design turned out. The main thing that I would change would be that the final slope <br>
            was steeper but it did work as is so I'm still happy with it.
