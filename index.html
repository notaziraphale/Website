            8/21-24/23 - Week 1 <br> This week we talked about saftey requirments for OSHA and did a project<br>
            of getting a marble the logest distance that we could under certian requrments. Our 
            stratagy<br> was to line people up in a line and have them trade off the pipes to pass the marble along. 
            It worked well even though it took a while to get the hang of. We also started learning about<br> makeing
            our website.

            8/28-8/31 - Week 2 <br> This week we took the quiz on the enginering proccess and saftey. We also started to 
            design a complicated way to get a baseball to pop a ballon. We started using tinkercad this week and I made a 
            cat bed with a cat in it. I find tinkercad really hard to control even though I understand the theory of how to 
            use it. I am better at using tinkercad then I was the first time and will keep improving.
